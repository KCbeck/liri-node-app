### LiriBot

1. The problem is that we have to switch between 5 differnt options and apply parameters with the spotify or movie app or it calls a default.

2. The app is organized by declaring the dependencies, then the functions then it goes in order based on the homework instructions.  There is a unique function to do an if else statement if not a value (!example) { } this worked great.

3. to run the app
- to use the spotify app type  (node liri.js  spotify-this-song "song title" or leave blank and get "The Sign by Ace of Base.
- to use the movies app type (node liri.js movie-this "movie title" or leave blank and get "Mr. Nobody.)

I built it using functions from our homework and other calls from the API webpage for spotify and bands in town.
